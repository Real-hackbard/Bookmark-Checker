In the context of the World Wide Web, a bookmark is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that is stored for later retrieval in any of various storage formats. All modern web browsers include [bookmark features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_browsers#Browser_features). Bookmarks are called favorites or Internet shortcuts in Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge, and by virtue of that browser's large market share, these terms have been synonymous with bookmark since the First Browser War. Bookmarks are normally accessed through a menu in the user's web browser, and folders are commonly used for organization. In addition to bookmarking methods within most browsers, many external applications offer [bookmarks management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmark_manager).

Each browser has a built-in tool for managing the list of bookmarks. The list storage method varies, depending on the browser, its version, and the operating system on which it runs.

Netscape browsers store bookmarks in the single HTML-coded file bookmarks.html. This approach permits publication and printing of a categorized and indented catalog, and works across platforms. Bookmark names need not be unique. Editing this file outside its native browser requires editing HTML.

For data portability and interoperability, most modern Web browsers support importing from and exporting to the Netscape bookmarks.html format.

A "bookmark checker" for Chrome isn't a built-in Chrome feature but rather third-party extensions, like the one from the Chrome Web Store (Bookmarks Checker), that find broken links, duplicates, and help clean up your bookmark library by batch checking URLs for validity, offering options to delete dead links with a click, and often adding features like smart search for your saved pages. These tools work by scanning your bookmarks, marking them as success, timeout, or error, and providing bulk actions to manage them, keeping your Chrome bookmarks organized and useful.

# How Bookmark Checkers Work:
Batch Checking: They scan multiple bookmarks at once to see if the linked pages still exist.
Status Indicators: Use symbols like green checkmarks (success), red crosses (error), or clocks (timeout) to show link health.
Duplicate Detection: Identify bookmarks pointing to the same URL.
Bulk Actions: Allow you to delete all broken or duplicate links in one go.
Smart Search: Some add a widget to search your bookmarks more effectively. 

# Finding & Using One:
Go to Chrome Web Store: Search for "bookmark checker".
Install an Extension: Choose one like "Bookmarks Checker".
Open the Extension: Click its icon, then click "CHECK ALL" (or similar) to start scanning.
Review & Clean: Use the "DELETE ALL" (for errors/timeouts) or "VIEW/HIDE" options to manage your list. 

# Comparisons across browsers:
Different browsers implement the bookmarks bar in slightly different ways, with varying functionality and usability.

* [Google Chrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome)

  * Google Chrome offers the ability to show or hide the bar with a simple keyboard shortcut ```Ctrl+Shift+B``` or through the browser menu (chrome://bookmarks) . It also includes a dedicated bookmark manager for advanced organization and supports integration with various extensions (e.g., "Bookmark Sidebar").

* [Mozilla Firefox](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Firefox)
  * Mozilla Firefox offers a customizable layout, allowing users to move the bookmarks bar or integrate it with other toolbars. It previously supported sending [RSS feeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_feeds) directly in the bar through a feature called "Live Bookmarks", and offers some add-ons as an alternative way for saving page-links.
